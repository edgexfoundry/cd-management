# What's in this image?

**ARCHIVED**
This image contains the legacy rules engine micro service, which receives data from the export service (via 0MQ) and then triggers actuation based on event data it receives and analyzes. It was built on Drools technology.  This service was used with older EdgeX Foundry releases.  It is no longer used or supported.

The service source code: https://github.com/edgexfoundry/support-rulesengine
