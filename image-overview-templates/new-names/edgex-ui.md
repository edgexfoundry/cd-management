# What's in this image?

This image contains the EdgeX UI, which is for **demonstration and developer use** to manage and monitor a single instance of EdgeX Foundry (unsecured).  Specifically, it can:

- Manage (add, remove, update) the EdgeX objects (device, device services, profiles, rules, app services, etc.)
- Monitor the EdgeX data flow (events and readings) and services
- Monitor and manage from on-box with EdgeX (on the same host)
