# What's in this image?

This image contains the appl service configurable. App-Service-Configurable is provided as an easy way to get started with processing data flowing through EdgeX. This service leverages the App Functions SDK and provides a way for developers to use configuration instead of having to compile standalone services to utilize built in functions in the SDK. Please refer to [Available Configurable Pipeline Functions](https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/2.0/microservices/application/AppServiceConfigurable/#available-configurable-pipeline-functions) for a full list of built in functions that can be used in the configurable pipeline.
