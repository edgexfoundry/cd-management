# What is EdgeX Foundry?

EdgeX Foundry is a vendor-neutral, open source project hosted by The Linux Foundation building a common open framework for IoT edge computing.  At the heart of the project is an interoperability framework hosted within a full hardware and OS agnostic reference software platform to enable an ecosystem of plug-and-play components that unifies the marketplace and accelerates the deployment of IoT solutions.

In simple terms, EdgeX is edge middleware - serving between physical sensing and actuating "things" and our information technology (IT) systems.

EdgeX's official documentation can be found at [docs.edgexfoundry.org](https://docs.edgexfoundry.org).
