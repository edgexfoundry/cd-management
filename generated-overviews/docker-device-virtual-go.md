# What is EdgeX Foundry?

EdgeX Foundry is a vendor-neutral, open source project hosted by The Linux Foundation building a common open framework for IoT edge computing.  At the heart of the project is an interoperability framework hosted within a full hardware and OS agnostic reference software platform to enable an ecosystem of plug-and-play components that unifies the marketplace and accelerates the deployment of IoT solutions.

In simple terms, EdgeX is edge middleware - serving between physical sensing and actuating "things" and our information technology (IT) systems.

EdgeX's official documentation can be found at [docs.edgexfoundry.org](https://docs.edgexfoundry.org).

# What's in this image?

This image contains the [virtual device service](https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/1.2/microservices/device/virtual/Ch-VirtualDevice/), which simulates different kinds of devices to generate events and readings to the core data micro service, and users send commands and get responses through the command and control micro service. These features of the virtual device services are useful when executing functional or performance tests without having any real devices.
